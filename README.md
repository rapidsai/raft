RAFT is a library containing building-blocks for rapid composition of RAPIDS Analytics. These building-blocks include shared representations, mathematical computational primitives, and utilities that accelerate building analytics and data science algorithms in the RAPIDS ecosystem. Both the C++ and Python components can be included in consuming libraries, providing building-blocks for both dense and sparse matrix formats in the following general categories:
#####
| Category | Description / Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Formats** | tensor representations and conversions for both sparse and dense formats |
| **Data Generation** | graph, spatial, and machine learning dataset generation |
| **Dense Operations** | linear algebra, statistics |
| **Spatial** | pairwise distances, nearest neighbors, neighborhood / proximity graph construction |
| **Sparse/Graph Operations** | linear algebra, statistics, slicing, msf, spectral embedding/clustering, slhc, vertex degree |
| **Solvers** | eigenvalue decomposition, least squares, lanczos |
| **Tools** | multi-node multi-gpu communicator, utilities |

By taking a primitives-based approach to algorithm development, RAFT accelerates algorithm construction time and reduces
the maintenance burden by maximizing reuse across projects. RAFT relies on the [RAPIDS memory manager (RMM)](https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm) which, 
like other projects in the RAPIDS ecosystem, eases the burden of configuring different allocation strategies globally 
across the libraries that use it. RMM also provides RAII wrappers around device arrays that handle the allocation and cleanup.

## Getting started

Refer to the [Build and Development Guide](BUILD.md) for details on RAFT's design, building, testing and development guidelines.

Most of the primitives in RAFT accept a `raft::handle_t` object for the management of resources which are expensive to create, such CUDA streams, stream pools, and handles to other CUDA libraries like `cublas` and `cusolver`. 


### C++ Example

The example below demonstrates creating a RAFT handle and using it with RMM's `device_uvector` to allocate memory on device and compute
pairwise Euclidean distances:
```c++
#include <raft/handle.hpp>
#include <raft/distance/distance.hpp>

#include <rmm/device_uvector.hpp>
raft::handle_t handle;

int n_samples = ...;
int n_features = ...;

rmm::device_uvector<float> input(n_samples * n_features, handle.get_stream());
rmm::device_uvector<float> output(n_samples * n_samples, handle.get_stream());

// ... Populate feature matrix ...

auto metric = raft::distance::DistanceType::L2SqrtExpanded;
rmm::device_uvector<char> workspace(0, handle.get_stream());
raft::distance::pairwise_distance(handle, input.data(), input.data(),
                                  output.data(),
                                  n_samples, n_samples, n_features,
                                  workspace.data(), metric);
```




## Folder Structure and Contents

The folder structure mirrors other RAPIDS repos (cuDF, cuML, cuGraph...), with the following folders:

- `cpp`: Source code for all C++ code. The code is currently header-only, therefore it is in the `include` folder (with no `src`).
- `python`: Source code for all Python source code.
- `ci`: Scripts for running CI in PRs
