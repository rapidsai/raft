## Overview

RAFT contains fundamental widely-used algorithms and primitives for data science and machine learning. The algorithms are CUDA-accelerated and form building blocks for rapidly composing analytics.

By taking a primitives-based approach to algorithm development, RAFT
- accelerates algorithm construction time
- reduces the maintenance burden by maximizing reuse across projects, and
- centralizes core reusable computations, allowing future optimizations to benefit all algorithms that use them.

While not exhaustive, the following general categories help summarize the accelerated functions in RAFT:
#####
| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Formats** | sparse & dense, conversions, data generation |
| **Dense Operations** | linear algebra, matrix and vector operations, reductions, slicing, norms, factorization, least squares, svd & eigenvalue problems |
| **Sparse Operations** | linear algebra, eigenvalue problems, slicing, norms, reductions, factorization, symmetrization, components & labeling |
| **Spatial** | pairwise distances, nearest neighbors, neighborhood graph construction |
| **Basic Clustering** | spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, k-means |
| **Solvers** | combinatorial optimization, iterative solvers |
| **Statistics** | sampling, moments and summary statistics, metrics |
| **Tools & Utilities** | common utilities for developing CUDA applications, multi-node multi-gpu infrastructure |


RAFT is a C++ header-only template library with an optional shared library that 
1) can speed up compile times for common template types, and 
2) provides host-accessible "runtime" APIs, which don't require a CUDA compiler to use

In addition being a C++ library, RAFT also provides 2 Python libraries:
- `pylibraft` - lightweight Python wrappers around RAFT's host-accessible "runtime" APIs.
- `raft-dask` - multi-node multi-GPU communicator infrastructure for building distributed algorithms on the GPU with Dask.

## Getting started

### RAPIDS Memory Manager (RMM)

RAFT relies heavily on RMM which eases the burden of configuring different allocation strategies globally across the libraries that use it.

### Multi-dimensional Arrays

The APIs in RAFT accept the [mdspan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06474) multi-dimensional array view for representing data in higher dimensions similar to the `ndarray` in the Numpy Python library. RAFT also contains the corresponding owning `mdarray` structure, which simplifies the allocation and management of multi-dimensional data in both host and device (GPU) memory.

The `mdarray` forms a convenience layer over RMM and can be constructed in RAFT using a number of different helper functions:

```c++
#include <raft/core/device_mdarray.hpp>

int n_rows = 10;
int n_cols = 10;

auto scalar = raft::make_device_scalar<float>(handle, 1.0);
auto vector = raft::make_device_vector<float>(handle, n_cols);
auto matrix = raft::make_device_matrix<float>(handle, n_rows, n_cols);
```

### C++ Example

Most of the primitives in RAFT accept a `raft::device_resources` object for the management of resources which are expensive to create, such CUDA streams, stream pools, and handles to other CUDA libraries like `cublas` and `cusolver`.

The example below demonstrates creating a RAFT handle and using it with `device_matrix` and `device_vector` to allocate memory, generating random clusters, and computing
pairwise Euclidean distances:
```c++
#include <raft/core/device_resources.hpp>
#include <raft/core/device_mdarray.hpp>
#include <raft/random/make_blobs.cuh>
#include <raft/distance/distance.cuh>

raft::device_resources handle;

int n_samples = 5000;
int n_features = 50;

auto input = raft::make_device_matrix<float, int>(handle, n_samples, n_features);
auto labels = raft::make_device_vector<int, int>(handle, n_samples);
auto output = raft::make_device_matrix<float, int>(handle, n_samples, n_samples);

raft::random::make_blobs(handle, input.view(), labels.view());

auto metric = raft::distance::DistanceType::L2SqrtExpanded;
raft::distance::pairwise_distance(handle, input.view(), input.view(), output.view(), metric);
```

It's also possible to create `raft::device_mdspan` views to invoke the same API with raw pointers and shape information:

```c++
#include <raft/core/device_resources.hpp>
#include <raft/core/device_mdspan.hpp>
#include <raft/random/make_blobs.cuh>
#include <raft/distance/distance.cuh>

raft::device_resources handle;

int n_samples = 5000;
int n_features = 50;

float *input;
int *labels;
float *output;

...
// Allocate input, labels, and output pointers
...

auto input_view = raft::make_device_matrix_view(input, n_samples, n_features);
auto labels_view = raft::make_device_vector_view(labels, n_samples);
auto output_view = raft::make_device_matrix_view(output, n_samples, n_samples);

raft::random::make_blobs(handle, input_view, labels_view);

auto metric = raft::distance::DistanceType::L2SqrtExpanded;
raft::distance::pairwise_distance(handle, input_view, input_view, output_view, metric);
```


### Python Example

The `pylibraft` package contains a Python API for RAFT algorithms and primitives. `pylibraft` integrates nicely into other libraries by being very lightweight with minimal dependencies and accepting any object that supports the `__cuda_array_interface__`, such as [CuPy's ndarray](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/user_guide/interoperability.html#rmm). The number of RAFT algorithms exposed in this package is continuing to grow from release to release.

The example below demonstrates computing the pairwise Euclidean distances between CuPy arrays. Note that CuPy is not a required dependency for `pylibraft`.

```python
import cupy as cp

from pylibraft.distance import pairwise_distance

n_samples = 5000
n_features = 50

in1 = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features), dtype=cp.float32)
in2 = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features), dtype=cp.float32)

output = pairwise_distance(in1, in2, metric="euclidean")
```

The `output` array in the above example is of type `raft.common.device_ndarray`, which supports [__cuda_array_interface__](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/cuda_array_interface.html#cuda-array-interface-version-2) making it interoperable with other libraries like CuPy, Numba, and PyTorch that also support it. CuPy supports DLPack, which also enables zero-copy conversion from `raft.common.device_ndarray` to JAX and Tensorflow.

Below is an example of converting the output `pylibraft.device_ndarray` to a CuPy array:
```python
cupy_array = cp.asarray(output)
```

And converting to a PyTorch tensor:
```python
import torch

torch_tensor = torch.as_tensor(output, device='cuda')
```

When the corresponding library has been installed and available in your environment, this conversion can also be done automatically by all RAFT compute APIs by setting a global configuration option:
```python
import pylibraft.config
pylibraft.config.set_output_as("cupy")  # All compute APIs will return cupy arrays
pylibraft.config.set_output_as("torch") # All compute APIs will return torch tensors
```

You can also specify a `callable` that accepts a `pylibraft.common.device_ndarray` and performs a custom conversion. The following example converts all output to `numpy` arrays:
```python
pylibraft.config.set_output_as(lambda device_ndarray: return device_ndarray.copy_to_host())
```

`pylibraft` also supports writing to a pre-allocated output array so any `__cuda_array_interface__` supported array can be written to in-place:

```python
import cupy as cp

from pylibraft.distance import pairwise_distance

n_samples = 5000
n_features = 50

in1 = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features), dtype=cp.float32)
in2 = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features), dtype=cp.float32)
output = cp.empty((n_samples, n_samples), dtype=cp.float32)

pairwise_distance(in1, in2, out=output, metric="euclidean")
```


## Installing

RAFT itself can be installed through conda, [CMake Package Manager (CPM)](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake), pip, or by building the repository from source. Please refer to the [build instructions](docs/source/build.md) for more a comprehensive guide on installing and building RAFT and using it in downstream projects.

### Conda

The easiest way to install RAFT is through conda and several packages are provided.
- `libraft-headers` RAFT headers
- `libraft` (optional) shared library of pre-compiled template specializations and runtime APIs.
- `pylibraft` (optional) Python wrappers around RAFT algorithms and primitives.
- `raft-dask` (optional) enables deployment of multi-node multi-GPU algorithms that use RAFT `raft::comms` in Dask clusters.

Use the following command to install all of the RAFT packages with conda (replace `rapidsai` with `rapidsai-nightly` to install more up-to-date but less stable nightly packages). `mamba` is preferred over the `conda` command.
```bash
mamba install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia raft-dask pylibraft
```

You can also install the conda packages individually using the `mamba` command above.

After installing RAFT, `find_package(raft COMPONENTS compiled distributed)` can be used in your CUDA/C++ cmake build to compile and/or link against needed dependencies in your raft target. `COMPONENTS` are optional and will depend on the packages installed.

### Pip

pylibraft and raft-dask both have experimental packages that can be [installed through pip](https://rapids.ai/pip.html#install):
```bash
pip install pylibraft-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
pip install raft-dask-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
```

### CMake & CPM

RAFT uses the [RAPIDS-CMake](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-cmake) library, which makes it easy to include in downstream cmake projects. RAPIDS-CMake provides a convenience layer around CPM. Please refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-cmake#installation) to install and use rapids-cmake in your project.

#### Example Template Project

You can find an [example RAFT](cpp/template/README.md) project template in the `cpp/template` directory, which demonstrates how to build a new application with RAFT or incorporate RAFT into an existing cmake project.

#### CMake Targets

Additional CMake targets can be made available by adding components in the table below to the `RAFT_COMPONENTS` list above, separated by spaces. The `raft::raft` target will always be available. RAFT headers require, at a minimum, the CUDA toolkit libraries and RMM dependencies.

| Component   | Target              | Description                                               | Base Dependencies                     |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| n/a         | `raft::raft`        | Full RAFT header library                                  | CUDA toolkit, RMM, NVTX, CCCL, CUTLASS |
| compiled    | `raft::compiled`    | Pre-compiled template specializations and runtime library | raft::raft                            |
| distributed | `raft::distributed` | Dependencies for `raft::comms` APIs                       | raft::raft, UCX, NCCL                 |

### Source

The easiest way to build RAFT from source is to use the `build.sh` script at the root of the repository:
1. Create an environment with the needed dependencies:
```
mamba env create --name raft_dev_env -f conda/environments/all_cuda-118_arch-x86_64.yaml
mamba activate raft_dev_env
```
```
./build.sh raft-dask pylibraft libraft tests bench --compile-lib
```

The [build](docs/source/build.md) instructions contain more details on building RAFT from source and including it in downstream projects. You can also find a more comprehensive version of the above CPM code snippet the [Building RAFT C++ from source](docs/source/build.md#building-raft-c-from-source-in-cmake) section of the build instructions.
