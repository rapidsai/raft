 * @brief 1-D block-level random sampling of an index.

 *
 * Let w_i be the weight stored on thread i.  We calculate the cumulative distribution function
 * F_i = sum_{k=0..i} weight_i.
 * Sequentially, we could select one of the elements with with the desired probability using the
 * following method. We can consider that each element has a subinterval assigned: [F_{i-1}, F_i).
 * We generate a uniform random number in the [0, F_i) range, and check which subinterval it falls.
 * We return idx corresponding to the selected subinterval.
 * In parallel, we do a tree reduction and make a selection at every step when we combine two
 * values.
