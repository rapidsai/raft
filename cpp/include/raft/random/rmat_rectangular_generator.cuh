/**
 * @brief Generate RMAT for a rectangular shaped adjacency matrices (useful when
 *        graphs to be generated are bipartite)
 *
 * @tparam IdxT  node indices type
 * @tparam ProbT data type used for probability distributions (either fp32 or fp64)
 *
 * @param[out] out     generated edgelist [on device] [dim = n_edges x 2]. On each row
 *                     the first element corresponds to the source node id while the
 *                     second, the destination node id. If you don't need this output
 *                     then pass a `nullptr` in its place.
 * @param[out] out_src list of source node id's [on device] [len = n_edges]. If you
 *                     don't need this output then pass a `nullptr` in its place.
 * @param[out] out_dst list of destination node id's [on device] [len = n_edges]. If
 *                     you don't need this output then pass a `nullptr` in its place.
 * @param[in]  theta   distribution of each quadrant at each level of resolution.
 *                     Since these are probabilities, each of the 2x2 matrix for
 *                     each level of the RMAT must sum to one. [on device]
 *                     [dim = max(r_scale, c_scale) x 2 x 2]. Of course, it is assumed
 *                     that each of the group of 2 x 2 numbers all sum up to 1.
 * @param[in]  r_scale 2^r_scale represents the number of source nodes
 * @param[in]  c_scale 2^c_scale represents the number of destination nodes
 * @param[in]  n_edges number of edges to generate
 * @param[in]  stream  cuda stream to schedule the work on
 * @param[in]  r       underlying state of the random generator. Especially useful when
 *                     one wants to call this API for multiple times in order to generate
 *                     a larger graph. For that case, just create this object with the
 *                     initial seed once and after every call continue to pass the same
 *                     object for the successive calls.
 *
 * When `r_scale != c_scale` it is referred to as rectangular adjacency matrix case (IOW generating
 * bipartite graphs). In this case, at `depth >= r_scale`, the distribution is assumed to be:
 * `[theta[4 * depth] + theta[4 * depth + 2], theta[4 * depth + 1] + theta[4 * depth + 3]; 0, 0]`.
 * Then for the `depth >= c_scale`, the distribution is assumed to be:
 * `[theta[4 * depth] + theta[4 * depth + 1], 0; theta[4 * depth + 2] + theta[4 * depth + 3], 0]`.
 *
 * @note This can generate duplicate edges and self-loops. It is the responsibility of the
 *       caller to clean them up accordingly.

 * @note This also only generates directed graphs. If undirected graphs are needed, then a
 *       separate post-processing step is expected to be done by the caller.
