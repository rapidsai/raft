 * @brief Computes the sum-reduction of matrix columns for each given key
 * @tparam T the input data type (as well as the output reduced matrix)
 * @tparam KeyType data type of the keys
 * @tparam IdxType indexing arithmetic type
 * @param data the input data (dim = nrows x ncols). This is assumed to be in
 * row-major layout
 * @param keys keys array (len = ncols). It is assumed that each key in this
 * array is between [0, nkeys). In case this is not true, the caller is expected
 * to have called make_monotonic primitive to prepare such a contiguous and
 * monotonically increasing keys array.
 * @param out the output reduced matrix along columns (dim = nrows x nkeys).
 * This will be assumed to be in row-major layout
 * @param nrows number of rows in the input data
 * @param ncols number of colums in the input data
 * @param nkeys number of unique keys in the keys array
 * @param stream cuda stream to launch the kernel onto
