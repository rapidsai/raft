What is RAFT?
#############

RAFT contains fundamental widely-used algorithms and primitives for machine learning and information retrieval. The algorithms are CUDA-accelerated and form building blocks for more easily writing high performance applications.

By taking a primitives-based approach to algorithm development, RAFT

- accelerates algorithm construction time
- reduces the maintenance burden by maximizing reuse across projects, and
- centralizes core reusable computations, allowing future optimizations to benefit all algorithms that use them.

While not exhaustive, the following general categories help summarize the accelerated building blocks that RAFT contains:
