Linear Algebra
==============

This page provides C++ class references for the publicly-exposed elements of the `raft/linalg` (dense) linear algebra headers.
In addition to providing highly optimized arithmetic and matrix/vector operations, RAFT provides a consistent user experience
by providing common BLAS routines, standard linear system solvers, factorization and eigenvalue solvers. Some of these routines
hide the complexities of lower-level C-based libraries provided in the CUDA toolkit
