Resources
=========

.. role:: py(code)
   :language: c++
   :class: highlight

All resources which are specific to a computing environment like host or device are contained within, and managed by,
`raft::resources`. This design simplifies the APIs and eases user burden by making the APIs opaque by default but allowing customization based on user preference.


Vocabulary
----------

``#include <raft/core/resource/resource_types.hpp>``

namespace *raft::resource*

 .. doxygengroup:: resource_types

Device Resources
----------------

`raft::device_resources` is a convenience over using `raft::resources` directly. It provides accessor methods to retrieve resources such as the CUDA stream, stream pool, and handles to the various CUDA math libraries like cuBLAS and cuSOLVER.

``#include <raft/core/device_resources.hpp>``

namespace *raft::core*

.. doxygenclass:: raft::device_resources

Device Resources Manager
------------------------

While `raft::device_resources` provides a convenient way to access
device-related resources for a sequence of RAFT calls, it is sometimes useful
to be able to limit those resources across an entire application. For
instance, in highly multi-threaded applications, it can be helpful to limit
the total number of streams rather than relying on the default stream per
thread. `raft::device_resources_manager` offers a way to access
`raft::device_resources` instances that draw from a limited pool of
underlying device resources.

Custom runtime-shared resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A custom resource is an arbitrary default-constructible C++ class.
The consumer of the API can keep such a resource in the `raft::resources` handle.
For example, consider a function that is expected to be called repeatedly and
involves a costly kernel configuration. One can cache the kernel configuration in
a custom resource.
The cost of accessing it is one hashmap lookup.
