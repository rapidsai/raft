Multi-node Multi-GPU
====================

RAFT contains C++ infrastructure for abstracting the communications layer when writing applications that scale on multiple nodes and across multiple GPUs. This infrastructure assumes OPG (one-process per GPU) architectures where multiple physical parallel units (processes, ranks, or workers) might be executing code concurrently but where each parallel unit is communicating with only a single GPU and is the only process communicating with each GPU.

The comms layer in RAFT is intended to provide a facade API for barrier synchronous collective communications, allowing users to write algorithms using a single abstraction layer and deploy in many different types of systems. Currently, RAFT communications code has been deployed in MPI, Dask, and Spark clusters.
